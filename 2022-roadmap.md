# 2022 Roadmap

The purpose of this page is to collaborate on the key objectives and goals to be achieved in 2022. This article uses the [OKR](https://rockcontent.com/br/blog/okr/) format to structure this year's roadmap. As always, this is community driven and a malleable document. Head over to the telegram if you have an idea to contribute.

### Objectives

Loser Land has the vision that everyone can have fun by playing this game. For 2022 the project has 3 goals that will help us get closer to this vision:

1. Keep developing the functions the origin team would like to do
2. Combine Sunflower Farmers with Squid Game
3. Stabilize the token price and reward long term farmers

## Features

These OKRs look great but how will the community achieve these? This section outlines a range of ideas and scoped items the team plans to tackle this year to move us closer to these goals.

### Pet Systems

A place that people can use their resource is the key to stabilize the token price. Although NFTs dose consume some resources, they are not attractive enough. We think a pet is more attractive, especially when masters can bring then to take the adventure and earn the prize. That's where the Squid Game we developed before comes in.

### Learn from other games

We will keep looking for other open-source games like Sunflower Farmers, learn their advantages and integrate them into Loser Land.&#x20;
