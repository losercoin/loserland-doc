# How to setup

The game requires users to have a **MetaMask** account to connect to the **OKEx** blockchain.

### Metamask Setup

> [ **MetaMask**](https://metamask.io) is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications

You will need to [download Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html) and install it on your preferred browser. Then you'll need to create a **MetaMask** account.

_Remember to keep you password and Secret Backup Phrase safe._

### _OEC_ Setup

> **OEC**, previously known as OKExChain, is open-source, public blockchain technology developed by [OKEx](https://www.okex.com) for building blockchain-based trading applications. OEC maintains the **$OKT** for its native utility token.

You'll need to connect your **MetaMask** account to the **OKEx** blockchain.

To connect to the OEC network you can use this link: [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org).\

Your Network configuration should look similar to the following:

### $SFF

You can also add the **$SFF** token to your MetaMask wallet to keep track of your earnings. To do that you will need to [add a custom token](https://medium.com/publicaio/how-to-add-a-custom-token-to-metamask-b24b090f1550) to your wallet and input the **$SFF** token contract address.

## How to Play?

Once you have connected to the OEC Network you are ready to Get Started. Please follow the in-game guide to start growing your farm.

### Donation to play

To create a farm, we require users to **donate a minimum** of `$0.01 OKT` to a charity of their choice. The OKT is donated directly to the charities blockchain address. You can choose from the following charities:

* [Loser Foundation](https://twitter.com/loser\_coin/status/1473491324993105921)
* [Help Programmer](https://losercoin.org)

#### Mining fees

Since the game is powered by blockchain technologies we must pay miners a _**small fee**_ each time that we want to save our farm to the blockchain. This fee ensures that our farm is **safe, secure and reliable.** Saving a farm to the blockchain depends on the current gas price of the network. When OEC is busy, the price increases. When it is quiet, it lessens.
