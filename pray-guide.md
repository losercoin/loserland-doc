# Pray Guide

When you have a statue, you can offer some $SFF and pray for something. For now, you can pray for $SQUID, which is the token used in previous games and will be a very important token in the future games.

### How to pray

First you need to build a potato statue:&#x20;

For now you need to offer $SFF that equals to 2 $SQUID's value, a quick calculation shows that each time you pray you are expected to win 2.4 $SQUID.&#x20;

However, you should not pray too often, or you will lose your luck. All players share a same luck which can be calculated by the following formula when the time between two prays less than two hours:

$$
\text{Luck}=1-(\frac{\text{2 hours - time since last pray}}{\text{2 hours}})^2
$$

After two hours, the luck will restore to it's maximum that equals to one. The luck number will influence to the chance you win the $SQUID.
